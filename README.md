# HER Kitchen Seattle

## About

Created by Harry Allen ([GitHub](https://github.com/MajesticString))

This was my first big project. I decided to use Angular instead of React or Vue because it kind of did everything, easiest to learn, and the file structure was the most organized.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
